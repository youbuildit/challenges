This challenge is inspired by the `head` and `tail` command-line tools in Unix-like systems. These tools are fundamental for quickly examining file contents, log monitoring, and data sampling. By building your own versions of `head` and `tail`, you'll learn about efficient file I/O, buffering strategies, and handling different text processing scenarios.

## Table of Contents

The `head` and `tail` commands exemplify efficient, focused file processing tools:

- **Efficiency**: Read only the necessary portions of files, even for very large files.
- **Simplicity**: Provide straightforward functionality for common use cases.
- **Flexibility**: Support various output formats and processing options.
- **Monitoring**: Enable real-time file monitoring (especially with `tail -f`).

You can learn more about the original commands by reading their manual pages:

```bash
man head
man tail
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to create two command-line tools:

1. **head** - Display the first part of files
2. **tail** - Display the last part of files

Both tools should handle multiple files, support various output formats, and work efficiently with large files.

## Supported Arguments

### head Tool Arguments:
- `-n num` or `--lines=num` - Print the first num lines (default: 10)
- `-c num` or `--bytes=num` - Print the first num bytes
- `-q` or `--quiet` - Never print headers giving file names
- `-v` or `--verbose` - Always print headers giving file names

### tail Tool Arguments:
- `-n num` or `--lines=num` - Print the last num lines (default: 10)
- `-c num` or `--bytes=num` - Print the last num bytes
- `-f` or `--follow` - Output appended data as the file grows
- `-F` or `--follow=name` - Follow file by name (handle log rotation)
- `-q` or `--quiet` - Never print headers giving file names
- `-v` or `--verbose` - Always print headers giving file names
- `--retry` - Keep trying to open a file even if it's inaccessible
- `-s num` or `--sleep-interval=num` - Sleep for num seconds between iterations

## Example Usage

Here's how your tools should work:

### head Examples:

```bash
# Display first 10 lines (default)
$ head file.txt
line 1
line 2
...
line 10

# Display first 5 lines
$ head -n 5 file.txt
line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
line 5

# Display first 100 bytes
$ head -c 100 file.txt
This is the beginning of the file with exactly 100 bytes of content displayed here.

# Multiple files with headers
$ head -n 3 file1.txt file2.txt
==> file1.txt <==
line 1 of file1
line 2 of file1
line 3 of file1

==> file2.txt <==
line 1 of file2
line 2 of file2
line 3 of file2

# Suppress headers
$ head -n 3 -q file1.txt file2.txt
line 1 of file1
line 2 of file1
line 3 of file1
line 1 of file2
line 2 of file2
line 3 of file2

# Read from stdin
$ echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" | head -n 3
a
b
c
```

### tail Examples:

```bash
# Display last 10 lines (default)
$ tail file.txt
line 991
line 992
...
line 1000

# Display last 5 lines
$ tail -n 5 file.txt
line 996
line 997
line 998
line 999
line 1000

# Display last 50 bytes
$ tail -c 50 file.txt
the end of the file with last 50 bytes shown.

# Follow file for new content (like log monitoring)
$ tail -f /var/log/system.log
Dec 25 10:30:15 system: Log entry 1
Dec 25 10:30:16 system: Log entry 2
[continues to show new lines as they're added]

# Follow by name (handles log rotation)
$ tail -F /var/log/rotating.log
[follows the file even if it gets rotated/recreated]

# Multiple files
$ tail -n 2 file1.txt file2.txt
==> file1.txt <==
second to last line of file1
last line of file1

==> file2.txt <==
second to last line of file2
last line of file2

# Show specific number of lines from end
$ tail -n +5 file.txt  # Show from line 5 to end
line 5
line 6
...
line 1000
```

## Implementation Steps

### For head:

1. **Basic Line Reading**:
   - Read files line by line until reaching the specified count
   - Handle the case where files have fewer lines than requested
   - Implement efficient reading for large files
   - Support reading from standard input

2. **Byte-based Reading**:
   - Read specified number of bytes from file beginning
   - Handle different character encodings properly
   - Avoid reading entire file into memory

3. **Multiple File Handling**:
   - Process multiple files with appropriate headers
   - Handle file access errors gracefully
   - Support header suppression and forcing

### For tail:

1. **Basic Line Reading**:
   - Efficiently find the last N lines without reading entire file
   - Implement reverse reading strategies
   - Handle files smaller than requested line count

2. **Byte-based Reading**:
   - Read last N bytes efficiently
   - Seek from end of file when possible
   - Handle cases where file is smaller than byte count

3. **File Following (tail -f)**:
   - Monitor file for changes using appropriate system calls
   - Implement polling with configurable intervals
   - Handle file truncation and rotation
   - Support graceful shutdown on interruption

4. **Advanced Following (tail -F)**:
   - Monitor file by name rather than file descriptor
   - Handle file recreation and rotation
   - Detect when followed file is deleted/replaced

## Extra Credit

Extend your `head` and `tail` implementations with these additional features:

### Enhanced Features:
1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement memory mapping for large files
   - Use efficient seeking strategies for tail
   - Optimize buffer sizes for different file types
   - Add parallel processing for multiple files

2. **Advanced Options**:
   - Support negative line numbers for head (-n -5 shows all but last 5)
   - Support positive line numbers for tail (-n +5 shows from line 5 to end)
   - Add `--max-unchanged-stats` for tail following
   - Implement `--pid` option to stop when process dies

3. **Enhanced File Following**:
   - Support following multiple files simultaneously
   - Add inotify/kqueue support for efficient file monitoring
   - Implement backoff strategies for busy files
   - Support following files across network filesystems

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - Add timestamp prefixes for followed output
   - Support custom header formats
   - Implement colorized output for different files
   - Add line numbering options

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handle permission errors
   - Support retrying for temporarily unavailable files
   - Handle interrupted system calls properly
   - Provide detailed error messages

6. **Binary File Support**:
   - Detect and handle binary files appropriately
   - Support hexadecimal output for binary content
   - Add options to force text interpretation
   - Handle mixed binary/text content

7. **Advanced File Operations**:
   - Support compressed file reading (gzip, bzip2)
   - Handle different line ending formats (Unix, Windows, Mac)
   - Support seeking in streams when possible
   - Add support for named pipes and special files

This challenge will teach you essential file I/O techniques, efficient data processing strategies, and system programming concepts that are fundamental to many other command-line utilities.
