This challenge is inspired by the `sort` command-line tool in Unix-like systems. The `sort` tool is essential for organizing and processing text data, commonly used in data analysis, log processing, and system administration. By building your own version of `sort`, you'll learn about sorting algorithms, text processing, and handling large datasets efficiently.

## Table of Contents

The `sort` command exemplifies efficient data processing with these key principles:

- **Efficiency**: Handle large files with optimal sorting algorithms and memory management.
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple sorting criteria and comparison methods.
- **Stability**: Maintain relative order of equal elements when needed.
- **Composability**: Work seamlessly with other Unix tools in pipelines.

You can learn more about the original `sort` command by reading its manual page:

```bash
man sort
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a command-line tool that sorts lines in text files according to various criteria. The tool should support different comparison methods, field-based sorting, and handle both small and large files efficiently.

## Supported Arguments

Your tool should support the following command-line arguments:

### Basic Sorting:
- `file...` - Input files to sort (default: standard input)
- `-o file` - Write output to specified file
- `-r` or `--reverse` - Sort in descending order
- `-u` or `--unique` - Output only unique lines
- `-s` or `--stable` - Use stable sorting algorithm

### Comparison Options:
- `-n` or `--numeric-sort` - Compare according to string numerical value
- `-g` or `--general-numeric-sort` - Compare according to general numeric value
- `-h` or `--human-numeric-sort` - Compare human-readable numbers (e.g., 2K, 1G)
- `-f` or `--ignore-case` - Fold lower case to upper case characters
- `-d` or `--dictionary-order` - Consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters

### Field-Based Sorting:
- `-k field` or `--key=field` - Sort via a key; field is F[.C][opts]
- `-t char` or `--field-separator=char` - Use char as field separator

### Advanced Options:
- `-m` or `--merge` - Merge already sorted files
- `-c` or `--check` - Check whether files are already sorted
- `-b` or `--ignore-leading-blanks` - Ignore leading blanks
- `--parallel=N` - Use N parallel processes for sorting

## Example Usage

Here's how your tool should work:

```bash
# Basic sorting (alphabetical)
$ sort names.txt
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David

# Reverse sort
$ sort -r names.txt
David
Charlie
Bob
Alice

# Numeric sort
$ sort -n numbers.txt
1
2
10
20
100

# Remove duplicates while sorting
$ sort -u duplicates.txt
apple
banana
orange

# Sort by specific field (comma-separated)
$ sort -t, -k2 data.csv
John,25,Engineer
Alice,28,Designer
Bob,32,Manager

# Sort by numeric field
$ sort -t, -k2n ages.csv
Alice,25,Engineer
Bob,28,Designer
John,32,Manager

# Case-insensitive sort
$ sort -f mixed_case.txt
apple
BANANA
cherry
ORANGE

# Human-readable numeric sort
$ sort -h sizes.txt
1K
2M
3G
1T

# Check if file is already sorted
$ sort -c sorted_file.txt
$ echo $?
0

# Sort multiple files and merge
$ sort file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined_sorted.txt

# Sort in place (output to same file)
$ sort -o file.txt file.txt

# Sort by multiple keys (primary: field 2, secondary: field 1)
$ sort -k2,2 -k1,1 multi_key.txt
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Read from files or standard input
   - Handle multiple input files
   - Process lines efficiently for large files
   - Support different character encodings

2. **Sorting Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Choose appropriate sorting algorithm (quicksort, mergesort, etc.)
   - Implement stable sorting when required
   - Handle memory constraints for large datasets
   - Consider external sorting for very large files

3. **Comparison Functions**:
   - Implement lexicographic comparison (default)
   - Add numeric comparison for numbers
   - Support case-insensitive comparison
   - Handle human-readable numbers (K, M, G suffixes)
   - Implement dictionary order comparison

4. **Field-Based Sorting**:
   - Parse field specifications (-k option)
   - Extract fields using specified separator
   - Handle complex field ranges and sub-fields
   - Support multiple sort keys with different options

5. **Memory Management**:
   - Optimize for large files that don't fit in memory
   - Implement external merge sort when needed
   - Use efficient data structures for line storage
   - Handle memory allocation failures gracefully

## Extra Credit

Extend your `sort` implementation with these additional features:

1. **Advanced Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Implement different sorting algorithms (heap sort, intro sort)
   - Add benchmarking to compare algorithm performance
   - Support adaptive algorithms that choose based on data characteristics
   - Implement parallel sorting for multi-core systems

2. **Enhanced Field Processing**:
   - Support regular expressions as field separators
   - Handle quoted fields in CSV data
   - Support complex field specifications (ranges, character positions)
   - Add support for fixed-width field parsing

3. **Locale and Internationalization**:
   - Support locale-aware sorting (collation)
   - Handle Unicode characters properly
   - Support different character encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
   - Implement culture-specific sorting rules

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement multi-threaded sorting
   - Add memory mapping for large files
   - Support streaming sort for infinite input
   - Optimize for specific data patterns (nearly sorted, reverse sorted)

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Support version number sorting (1.2.10 vs 1.2.9)
   - Add random shuffle mode
   - Implement sampling for large dataset preview
   - Support compressed input files

6. **Debugging and Analysis**:
   - Add verbose mode to show sorting progress
   - Implement profiling to analyze performance bottlenecks
   - Add memory usage reporting
   - Support dry-run mode to validate parameters

This challenge will teach you fundamental algorithms, efficient text processing, and memory management techniques that are essential for building high-performance command-line tools.
