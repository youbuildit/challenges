This challenge is inspired by the `diff` command-line tool in Unix-like systems. The `diff` tool is essential for comparing files, tracking changes, and understanding differences between versions of text. By building your own version of `diff`, you'll learn about difference algorithms, text processing, and the foundation of version control systems.

## Table of Contents

The `diff` command is fundamental to software development and system administration:

- **Change Detection**: Identify what has changed between two versions of text.
- **Algorithm Understanding**: Implement classic algorithms like Myers' diff or Longest Common Subsequence.
- **Output Formatting**: Present differences in various human-readable formats.
- **Efficiency**: Handle large files and minimize computational complexity.

You can learn more about the original `diff` command by reading its manual page:

```bash
man diff
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a command-line tool that compares two files line by line and shows the differences between them. The tool should support various output formats and handle different comparison scenarios.

## Supported Arguments

Your tool should support the following command-line arguments:

### Basic Options:
- `file1 file2` - Compare two files
- `-u` or `--unified` - Output in unified format (default context: 3 lines)
- `-c` or `--context` - Output in context format (default context: 3 lines)
- `-e` or `--ed` - Output in ed script format
- `--normal` - Output in normal diff format (default)

### Context Control:
- `-C num` or `--context=num` - Use num lines of context
- `-U num` or `--unified=num` - Use num lines of unified context
- `--unchanged-line-format=format` - Format for unchanged lines
- `--old-line-format=format` - Format for lines only in file1
- `--new-line-format=format` - Format for lines only in file2

### Comparison Options:
- `-i` or `--ignore-case` - Ignore case differences
- `-w` or `--ignore-all-space` - Ignore all whitespace differences
- `-b` or `--ignore-space-change` - Ignore changes in amount of whitespace
- `-B` or `--ignore-blank-lines` - Ignore blank line changes
- `-E` or `--ignore-tab-expansion` - Ignore changes due to tab expansion

### Output Options:
- `-q` or `--brief` - Only report whether files differ
- `-s` or `--report-identical-files` - Report when files are identical
- `--label=label` - Use label instead of filename in output
- `-T` or `--initial-tab` - Prepend a tab to each line
- `--suppress-common-lines` - Don't output common lines in context format

## Example Usage

Here's how your tool should work:

### Normal Format (default):

```bash
$ diff file1.txt file2.txt
2c2
< apple
---
> orange
4a5
> grape
```

### Unified Format:

```bash
$ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
--- file1.txt	2024-01-15 10:30:00
+++ file2.txt	2024-01-15 10:35:00
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 banana
-apple
+orange
 cherry
 date
+grape
```

### Context Format:

```bash
$ diff -c file1.txt file2.txt
*** file1.txt	2024-01-15 10:30:00
--- file2.txt	2024-01-15 10:35:00
***************
*** 1,4 ****
  banana
! apple
  cherry
  date
--- 1,5 ----
  banana
! orange
  cherry
  date
+ grape
```

### Brief Mode:

```bash
$ diff -q file1.txt file2.txt
Files file1.txt and file2.txt differ

$ diff -q identical1.txt identical2.txt
$ echo $?
0
```

### Case-insensitive Comparison:

```bash
$ diff -i case1.txt case2.txt
# No output if files differ only in case
```

### Custom Labels:

```bash
$ diff --label=original --label=modified -u file1.txt file2.txt
--- original	2024-01-15 10:30:00
+++ modified	2024-01-15 10:35:00
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@

-line2
+LINE2

```

## Implementation Steps

1. **File Reading and Preprocessing**:
   - Read both files into memory or process line by line
   - Handle different line ending formats (Unix, Windows, Mac)
   - Apply preprocessing based on options (ignore case, whitespace, etc.)
   - Handle binary files appropriately

2. **Diff Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Implement Myers' algorithm or Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
   - Create a diff representation showing additions, deletions, and changes
   - Optimize for performance with large files
   - Handle edge cases (empty files, identical files, etc.)

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Implement normal diff format
   - Add unified diff format with context lines
   - Support context diff format
   - Handle line numbering and range calculations

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Support various ignore options (whitespace, case, blank lines)
   - Implement custom line formatting
   - Add brief mode for quick comparisons
   - Handle file timestamps and labels

## Extra Credit

Extend your `diff` implementation with these additional features:

1. **Advanced Algorithms**:
   - Implement Patience diff algorithm for better results
   - Add histogram diff for improved performance
   - Support word-level and character-level diff
   - Implement three-way merge diff

2. **Enhanced Output Formats**:
   - Add side-by-side comparison format
   - Implement colored output for terminal display
   - Support HTML output with syntax highlighting
   - Add JSON output format for programmatic use

3. **Directory Comparison**:
   - Compare entire directory trees recursively
   - Handle file creation/deletion in directories
   - Support filtering files by pattern or type
   - Generate summary reports for directory changes

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement streaming diff for very large files
   - Add parallel processing for directory comparisons
   - Use memory mapping for efficient file access
   - Optimize for specific file patterns (mostly similar, completely different)

5. **Binary File Support**:
   - Detect binary files and handle appropriately
   - Implement hexdump-style diff for binary content
   - Support mixed binary/text file handling
   - Add options to force text treatment of binary files

6. **Advanced Comparison Options**:
   - Support regular expression-based line ignoring
   - Implement fuzzy matching for similar lines
   - Add option to ignore specific patterns
   - Support custom comparison functions

7. **Integration Features**:
   - Generate patches that can be applied with `patch` command
   - Support Git-style diff format
   - Add statistics reporting (lines added/deleted/changed)
   - Implement diff merging capabilities

8. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
   - Handle very large files gracefully
   - Support files with different encodings
   - Handle permission errors and missing files
   - Provide meaningful error messages

This challenge will teach you fundamental algorithms used in version control systems, text processing techniques, and the complexities involved in accurately detecting and presenting differences between texts.
