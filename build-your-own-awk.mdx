This challenge is inspired by the `awk` programming language and command-line tool in Unix-like systems. AWK is a powerful pattern-scanning and data extraction language that processes text files line by line, splitting each line into fields and executing actions based on patterns. By building your own version of `awk`, you'll learn about interpreter design, text processing, and domain-specific languages.

## Table of Contents

AWK demonstrates several important programming language concepts:

- **Pattern-Action Model**: Execute code blocks based on pattern matching.
- **Built-in Variables**: Provide context and state information automatically.
- **Field Processing**: Automatically split input into fields for easy manipulation.
- **Text Processing**: Combine programming constructs with text manipulation.

You can learn more about the original `awk` language by reading its manual page:

```bash
man awk
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to implement a simplified AWK interpreter that can process text files using pattern-action rules. The tool should support field splitting, built-in variables, basic programming constructs, and pattern matching.

## Core Features

Your AWK implementation should support:

1. **Pattern-Action Structure**: `pattern { action }`
2. **Built-in Variables**:
   - `NR` - Current record (line) number
   - `NF` - Number of fields in current record
   - `$0` - Entire current record
   - `$1, $2, ...` - Individual fields
   - `FS` - Field separator (default: whitespace)
   - `RS` - Record separator (default: newline)
   - `OFS` - Output field separator (default: space)
   - `ORS` - Output record separator (default: newline)

3. **Built-in Functions**:
   - `print` - Print arguments or current record
   - `printf` - Formatted printing
   - `length(string)` - String length
   - `substr(string, start, length)` - Substring
   - `split(string, array, separator)` - Split string into array

4. **Programming Constructs**:
   - Variables and assignments
   - Arithmetic operations
   - String operations
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
   - Loops (`for`, `while`)

## Example Usage

Here's how your AWK tool should work:

```bash
# Print specific fields
$ awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt

# Pattern matching
$ awk '/error/ {print NR, $0}' logfile.txt

# Field counting
$ awk '{print NF}' file.txt

# Conditional processing
$ awk 'NR > 1 {print "Line " NR ": " $0}' file.txt

# BEGIN and END patterns
$ awk 'BEGIN {print "Processing file..."} {count++} END {print "Total lines:", count}' file.txt

# Field separator customization
$ awk -F: '{print $1, $6}' /etc/passwd

# Mathematical operations
$ awk '{sum += $1} END {print "Sum:", sum}' numbers.txt

# String operations
$ awk '{print length($0)}' file.txt

# Conditional statements
$ awk '{if ($1 > 100) print $0 " is large"}' numbers.txt

# Multiple patterns and actions
$ awk '/start/ {flag=1} flag==1 {print} /end/ {flag=0}' file.txt
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - Tokenize AWK source code into keywords, operators, strings, numbers
   - Handle different token types (patterns, actions, expressions)
   - Support string literals and regular expression literals

2. **Parsing**:
   - Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
   - Parse pattern-action rules
   - Handle programming constructs (if, while, for)
   - Parse expressions and function calls

3. **Built-in Variables**:
   - Implement automatic field splitting
   - Maintain record and field count variables
   - Support configurable field and record separators
   - Handle field assignment and modification

4. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Implement regex pattern matching
   - Support BEGIN and END special patterns
   - Handle numeric range patterns
   - Support pattern combinations

5. **Action Execution**:
   - Implement variable storage and retrieval
   - Execute arithmetic and string operations
   - Handle built-in functions
   - Support control flow statements

## Advanced AWK Features

```bash
# Arrays (associative)
$ awk '{count[$1]++} END {for (word in count) print word, count[word]}' file.txt

# Multiple field separators
$ awk -F'[,:]' '{print $2}' file.txt

# Regular expression matching
$ awk '$0 ~ /pattern/ {print}' file.txt

# String functions
$ awk '{print toupper($1)}' file.txt

# Mathematical functions
$ awk '{print sqrt($1)}' numbers.txt

# File processing
$ awk '{print > "output_" NR ".txt"}' input.txt
```

## Extra Credit

Extend your AWK implementation with these additional features:

1. **Advanced Data Types**:
   - Associative arrays with proper iteration
   - Multi-dimensional arrays
   - Automatic string-number conversion
   - Type coercion rules

2. **Enhanced Built-in Functions**:
   - `toupper()`, `tolower()` - Case conversion
   - `gsub()`, `sub()` - Global/single substitution
   - `match()` - Pattern matching with position
   - `sprintf()` - String formatting
   - Mathematical functions (`sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, etc.)

3. **Advanced Pattern Matching**:
   - Range patterns (`/start/,/end/`)
   - Compound patterns with logical operators
   - Field-specific patterns (`$1 ~ /pattern/`)
   - Numeric comparison patterns

4. **File I/O and System Integration**:
   - Multiple input files with `FILENAME` variable
   - Output redirection (`print > "file"`)
   - Pipe output to commands (`print | "command"`)
   - Command execution with `system()`

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Optimize field splitting for different separators
   - Implement efficient associative array structures
   - Cache compiled regular expressions
   - Add memory management for large datasets

6. **Error Handling and Debugging**:
   - Comprehensive syntax error reporting
   - Runtime error handling
   - Debug mode with step-by-step execution
   - Variable inspection capabilities

7. **Extended Language Features**:
   - User-defined functions
   - Local variables and scope
   - Return statements
   - Function libraries

This challenge will give you deep insights into language design, text processing algorithms, and the elegant simplicity that makes AWK so powerful for data manipulation tasks.
