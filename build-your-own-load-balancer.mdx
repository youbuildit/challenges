This challenge is inspired by load balancers, critical components in scalable web architectures. A load balancer efficiently distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, improving reliability, performance, and scalability. By building your own load balancer, you'll gain hands-on experience with networking and concurrency, as well as an understanding of different load-balancing strategies.

## Table of Contents

Modern distributed systems rely heavily on load balancers to:

- **Ensure Reliability**: Distribute traffic to prevent overloading any single server.
- **Optimize Performance**: Route requests to the server best equipped to handle them.
- **Enhance Scalability**: Add or remove backend servers dynamically.

By implementing a load balancer, you’ll explore the concepts and challenges of building scalable systems.

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a simple load balancer that listens for incoming HTTP requests and distributes them to a set of backend servers based on a load-balancing strategy.

The load balancer should support:

1. **Multiple Backend Servers**: Maintain a list of backend servers and route traffic to them.
2. **Health Checks**: Periodically check the availability of backend servers.
3. **Load-Balancing Strategies**:
   - Round Robin
   - Least Connections
   - Random
4. **Concurrency**: Handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Here’s how your load balancer should behave:

1. **Configuration**: Provide a list of backend servers as input.

```bash
$ myloadbalancer --servers http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8082,http://localhost:8083
```

2. **Routing**: Distribute incoming requests to the backend servers based on the selected strategy.

```bash
# Simulate multiple client requests
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
```

- Backend server logs:
- Server 1: Received request 1
- Server 2: Received request 2
- Server 3: Received request 3

3. **Health Checks**: If a backend server becomes unavailable, stop routing requests to it.

```bash
# Take down server 2
$ kill -9 <server2_pid>

# Client requests are redistributed:
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
# Backend server logs:
# Server 1: Received request 4
# Server 3: Received request 5
```

4. **Dynamic Server Management**: Allow adding or removing backend servers dynamically.

```bash
$ myloadbalancer add http://localhost:8084
$ myloadbalancer remove http://localhost:8083
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Networking**:
- Set up a server to listen for incoming HTTP requests.
- Forward requests to backend servers and relay their responses to clients.

2. **Concurrency**:
- Use multi-threading or asynchronous I/O to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.

3. **Load-Balancing Strategies**:
- Implement Round Robin, Least Connections, and Random routing.
- Allow users to select the desired strategy via command-line arguments.

4. **Health Checks**:
- Periodically send ping or health-check requests to backend servers.
- Mark servers as unavailable if health checks fail.

5. **Dynamic Server Management**:
- Maintain an up-to-date list of backend servers.
- Provide commands for adding or removing servers at runtime.

## Extra Credit

Extend your load balancer with the following features:

1. **Weighted Load Balancing**:
- Allow backend servers to have different weights, handling traffic proportionally.

2. **Sticky Sessions**:
- Ensure requests from the same client are routed to the same backend server.

3. **TLS Support**:
- Add SSL/TLS support to secure client connections.

4. **Metrics and Logging**:
- Track and log request counts, response times, and server status.

5. **Dynamic Configuration Reload**:
- Implement support for reloading configuration without restarting the load balancer.

6. **Failover and Redundancy**:
- Add support for fallback servers if all primary servers fail.

By completing these extensions, your load balancer will approach the functionality of production-ready tools, giving you valuable insights into networking and distributed systems.
