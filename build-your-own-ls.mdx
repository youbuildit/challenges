This challenge is inspired by the `ls` command-line tool in Unix-like systems. The `ls` tool is essential for navigating and understanding file systems, displaying directory contents with various formatting and sorting options. By building your own version of `ls`, you'll learn about file system operations, metadata handling, and output formatting.

## Table of Contents

The `ls` command embodies several key Unix principles:

- **Clarity**: Present information in a clean, readable format.
- **Flexibility**: Support various display options for different use cases.
- **Efficiency**: Handle large directories without performance issues.

You can learn more about the original `ls` command by reading its manual page:

```bash
man ls
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a command-line tool that lists the contents of directories with various formatting options. The tool should display file names, sizes, permissions, timestamps, and other metadata based on specified flags.

## Supported Arguments

Your tool should support the following command-line arguments:

- `-l` or `--long`: Use long listing format showing detailed information
- `-a` or `--all`: Show all files, including hidden files (starting with `.`)
- `-h` or `--human-readable`: Display file sizes in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB)
- `-t` or `--time`: Sort files by modification time (newest first)
- `-r` or `--reverse`: Reverse the sort order
- `-S` or `--size`: Sort files by size (largest first)
- `-R` or `--recursive`: List subdirectories recursively
- `-1` or `--format=single-column`: List one file per line

When no directory is specified, list the current directory.

## Example Usage

Here's how your tool should work:

```bash
# List current directory
$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Pictures  file.txt

# Long format listing
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  staff  160 Jan 15 10:30 Documents
drwxr-xr-x  3 user  staff   96 Jan 14 15:20 Downloads
drwxr-xr-x  2 user  staff   64 Jan 10 09:15 Pictures
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff 1024 Jan 16 14:45 file.txt

# Show all files including hidden
$ ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  6 user  staff  192 Jan 16 14:45 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 user  staff  128 Jan 15 10:00 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   21 Jan 14 12:00 .hidden
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  staff  160 Jan 15 10:30 Documents

# Human-readable file sizes
$ ls -lh
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  staff  160B Jan 15 10:30 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  1.0K Jan 16 14:45 file.txt

# Sort by time (newest first)
$ ls -lt
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff 1024 Jan 16 14:45 file.txt
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  staff  160 Jan 15 10:30 Documents
drwxr-xr-x  3 user  staff   96 Jan 14 15:20 Downloads

# Recursive listing
$ ls -R
.:
Documents  file.txt

./Documents:
project1  project2
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Directory Reading**:
   - Use your language's directory reading functions to list files
   - Handle permission errors gracefully
   - Filter hidden files based on options

2. **File Metadata**:
   - Retrieve file size, modification time, permissions, and owner information
   - Handle symbolic links and special files appropriately
   - Calculate total sizes for directories if needed

3. **Formatting and Display**:
   - Implement columnar output for default view
   - Create detailed long format with aligned columns
   - Convert file sizes to human-readable format
   - Format timestamps consistently

4. **Sorting and Filtering**:
   - Implement different sorting algorithms (name, time, size)
   - Support reverse sorting
   - Handle case-sensitive vs case-insensitive sorting

5. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Implement directory tree traversal
   - Handle circular references and deep directory structures
   - Format recursive output clearly

## Extra Credit

Extend your `ls` implementation with these additional features:

1. **Advanced Display Options**:
   - `-i` to show inode numbers
   - `-F` to classify files with indicators (`/` for directories, `*` for executables)
   - `--color` to colorize output based on file types

2. **Enhanced Sorting**:
   - `-X` to sort alphabetically by file extension
   - `-v` to sort naturally (handle numbers in filenames correctly)
   - Custom sort orders

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement efficient sorting algorithms for large directories
   - Add parallel processing for recursive operations
   - Optimize memory usage for very large directories

4. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Handle different file system types and permissions
   - Support Windows-style attributes and permissions
   - Adapt to different terminal capabilities

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement glob pattern matching for file filtering
   - Add support for multiple directory arguments
   - Show file type detection and MIME types
   - Display file checksums or other metadata

This challenge will teach you fundamental file system operations and give you a deeper appreciation for the complexity behind seemingly simple command-line tools.
