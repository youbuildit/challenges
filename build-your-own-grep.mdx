This challenge is inspired by the `grep` command-line tool in Unix-like systems. The `grep` tool searches for patterns in files using regular expressions and outputs the matching lines. By building your own version of `grep`, you'll deepen your understanding of regular expressions, text processing, and file I/O.

## Table of Contents

The tools in Linux and Unix-like systems are excellent examples of good software engineering because they follow the _Unix Philosophies_ of:

- **Modularity**: Each tool should do one thing well.
- **Composability**: Tools can be combined to perform more complex tasks.

Understanding and implementing tools like `grep` will help you appreciate these principles in practice. You can read more about the Unix Philosophy in [_The Art of Unix Programming_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html).

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a command-line tool that searches for a specified pattern in a file and outputs the matching lines. Your tool should support regular expressions and accept both the search pattern and the file path as command-line arguments.

To understand the functional requirements of `grep`, refer to its `man` page:

```bash
man grep
```

## Supported Arguments

Your tool should support the following command-line arguments:

- `-i` or `--ignore-case`: Perform a case-insensitive search.
- `-v` or `--invert-match`: Invert the search to display lines that do not match the pattern.
- `-c` or `--count`: Display only the count of matching lines.
- `-n` or `--line-number`: Display line numbers along with matching lines.
- `-r` or `--recursive`: Search for the pattern recursively in all files under a directory.

Additionally, your tool should handle the following cases:

- If no pattern or file is specified, display usage instructions.
- If only the pattern is specified, read input from standard input (e.g., via a pipe).

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how your tool should behave:

```bash
# Search for "error" in a file
$ grep "error" file.txt
An error occurred in the system.

# Case-insensitive search
$ grep -i "error" file.txt
An error occurred in the system.
ERROR: Unable to connect.

# Count matching lines
$ grep -c "error" file.txt
2

# Display line numbers
$ grep -n "error" file.txt
2: An error occurred in the system.
5: ERROR: Unable to connect.

# Invert the match
$ grep -v "error" file.txt
No issues detected.

# Recursive search in a directory
$ grep -r "error" logs/
logs/system.log:2: An error occurred in the system.
logs/connection.log:5: ERROR: Unable to connect.

# Read from standard input
$ echo "This is a test" | grep "test"
This is a test
```

## Regular Expressions

Support for regular expressions is central to the functionality of `grep`. At a minimum, your implementation should handle:

- Literal string matches (e.g., `error`)
- Wildcards (e.g., `er.*`)
- Anchors (e.g., `^start` or `end$`)

You can learn more about regular expressions in [_Mastering Regular Expressions_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-regular-expressions/).

## Extra Credit

Extend your implementation with the following features:

1. **Colorized Output**: Highlight the matched pattern in the output using terminal colors.
2. **Multiline Search**: Support for matching patterns across multiple lines.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Optimize recursive searches using multiple threads or processes.
4. **Contextual Matches**: Add `-A`, `-B`, and `-C` options to display lines around the matching line (e.g., `-A 2` for 2 lines after the match).

With these extensions, your tool can handle even more complex text processing scenarios.
