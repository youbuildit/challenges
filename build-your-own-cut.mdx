This challenge is inspired by the `cut` command-line tool in Unix-like systems. The `cut` tool is essential for extracting specific columns or character ranges from structured text data, commonly used in data processing, log analysis, and CSV manipulation. By building your own version of `cut`, you'll learn about text processing, string manipulation, and efficient data extraction.

## Table of Contents

The `cut` command follows the Unix philosophy of focused, efficient text processing:

- **Precision**: Extract exactly the data you need from structured text.
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple extraction methods (fields, characters, bytes).
- **Efficiency**: Process large files quickly with minimal memory usage.
- **Composability**: Work seamlessly with other tools in Unix pipelines.

You can learn more about the original `cut` command by reading its manual page:

```bash
man cut
```

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a command-line tool that extracts selected portions of lines from files or standard input. The tool should support extracting by character position, byte position, or delimited fields.

## Supported Arguments

Your tool should support the following command-line arguments:

### Selection Options (choose one):
- `-c list` or `--characters=list` - Select by character positions
- `-b list` or `--bytes=list` - Select by byte positions
- `-f list` or `--fields=list` - Select by fields (delimited)

### Field Options:
- `-d delim` or `--delimiter=delim` - Use delim as field delimiter (default: TAB)
- `-s` or `--only-delimited` - Only print lines containing delimiters
- `--output-delimiter=string` - Use string as output delimiter

### List Format:
- `N` - The Nth character/byte/field (counted from 1)
- `N-` - From Nth character/byte/field to end of line
- `N-M` - From Nth to Mth character/byte/field (inclusive)
- `-M` - From first to Mth character/byte/field
- Multiple ranges can be comma-separated: `1,3,5-7`

## Example Usage

Here's how your tool should work:

```bash
# Extract specific characters
$ echo "Hello World" | cut -c 1-5
Hello

$ echo "Hello World" | cut -c 7-
World

$ echo "Hello World" | cut -c 1,3,5
Hlo

# Extract fields from delimited data
$ echo "apple,banana,cherry" | cut -d, -f 2
banana

$ echo -e "a:b:c\nd:e:f" | cut -d: -f 1,3
a:c
d:f

# Process CSV file
$ cut -d, -f 1,3 data.csv
Name,Age
Alice,25
Bob,30
Carol,28

# Extract byte ranges (useful for binary or multi-byte characters)
$ echo "Hello" | cut -b 2-4
ell

# Use different output delimiter
$ echo "a,b,c,d" | cut -d, -f 2,4 --output-delimiter="|"
b|d

# Only show lines that contain the delimiter
$ echo -e "no-delimiter\nhas:delimiter" | cut -d: -f 2 -s
delimiter

# Multiple files
$ cut -d, -f 1 file1.csv file2.csv
==> file1.csv <==
Alice
Bob

==> file2.csv <==
Carol
David

# Complex field ranges
$ echo "a,b,c,d,e,f" | cut -d, -f 1,3-5
a,c,d,e

# Use TAB as delimiter (default)
$ echo -e "col1\tcol2\tcol3" | cut -f 2
col2
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Command-Line Parsing**:
   - Parse extraction mode (characters, bytes, or fields)
   - Handle delimiter specifications
   - Parse range lists with proper error handling
   - Validate argument combinations

2. **Range Processing**:
   - Parse range specifications (N, N-M, N-, -M)
   - Handle comma-separated multiple ranges
   - Sort and merge overlapping ranges for efficiency
   - Validate range bounds and ordering

3. **Character/Byte Extraction**:
   - Extract characters by position (handle Unicode properly)
   - Extract bytes by position (for binary data or specific encodings)
   - Handle out-of-bounds indices gracefully
   - Support multiple character encodings

4. **Field Extraction**:
   - Split lines using specified delimiter
   - Extract specified field numbers
   - Handle missing fields (fewer fields than requested)
   - Support different output delimiters

5. **Input Processing**:
   - Read from files or standard input
   - Process lines efficiently for large files
   - Handle different line endings (Unix, Windows, Mac)
   - Implement proper error handling for file access

## Extra Credit

Extend your `cut` implementation with these additional features:

1. **Advanced Range Processing**:
   - Support reverse ranges (M-N where M > N)
   - Add step specification (every Nth character/field)
   - Implement range validation and optimization
   - Support negative indexing (counting from end)

2. **Enhanced Delimiter Support**:
   - Support regular expressions as delimiters
   - Handle quoted fields in CSV data
   - Support escape sequences in delimiters (\t, \n, etc.)
   - Add support for multi-character delimiters

3. **Character Encoding Support**:
   - Proper Unicode handling for multi-byte characters
   - Support different character encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
   - Handle byte-order marks (BOM) in files
   - Provide encoding detection capabilities

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement streaming processing for large files
   - Optimize memory usage for wide files
   - Add parallel processing for multiple files
   - Implement efficient range merging algorithms

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Support field reordering and duplication
   - Add complement mode (extract everything except specified ranges)
   - Implement header preservation for CSV files
   - Support fixed-width field extraction

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - Add padding options for consistent column widths
   - Support custom output formatting
   - Implement alignment options (left, right, center)
   - Add number formatting for numeric fields

7. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Provide detailed error messages for invalid ranges
   - Add warnings for out-of-bounds field access
   - Implement dry-run mode to validate parameters
   - Support different error handling strategies

This challenge will teach you essential text processing skills, string manipulation techniques, and the importance of handling edge cases in data extraction tools.
