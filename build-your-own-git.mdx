This challenge is inspired by Git, the most widely used version control system in software development. By building your own Git-like system, you'll learn about content-addressable storage, tree structures, distributed systems, and the algorithms that make modern version control possible.

## Table of Contents

Understanding how version control systems work is fundamental to modern software development. Key principles include:

- **Content Addressability**: Use cryptographic hashes to identify and store content uniquely.
- **Immutability**: Once created, objects never change, ensuring data integrity.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Enable multiple repositories to sync and collaborate.
- **Efficiency**: Store only changes between versions to minimize space usage.

You can learn more about Git's internals in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain).

## The Challenge

Your task is to implement a Git-like version control system that supports:

1. Repository initialization and basic object storage
2. Staging area (index) management
3. Commits and commit history
4. Branching and merging
5. Remote repository operations
6. Basic file diff algorithms

## Supported Features

Your Git implementation should support the following core functionality:

1. **Repository Management**:
   - `init` - Initialize a new repository
   - `status` - Show working tree status
   - `log` - Show commit history

2. **Staging and Committing**:
   - `add <file>` - Add file contents to the staging area
   - `commit -m <message>` - Record changes to the repository
   - `reset <file>` - Unstage a file
   - `diff` - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

3. **Branching**:
   - `branch [name]` - List or create branches
   - `checkout <branch>` - Switch branches or restore working tree files
   - `merge <branch>` - Join two or more development histories together

4. **Object Storage**:
   - Implement blob, tree, and commit objects
   - Use SHA-1 hashing for content addressing
   - Store objects in compressed format

5. **Remote Operations**:
   - `clone <url>` - Clone a repository into a new directory
   - `push` - Update remote refs along with associated objects
   - `pull` - Fetch from and integrate with another repository

## Example Usage

Here's how your Git system should behave:

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
$ mygit init
Initialized empty repository in .mygit/

# Add and commit files
$ echo "Hello World" > README.md
$ mygit add README.md
$ mygit status
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   README.md

$ mygit commit -m "Initial commit"
[main 1a2b3c4] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

# View commit history
$ mygit log
commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
Author: Developer <dev@example.com>
Date: Mon Jan 1 12:00:00 2024

    Initial commit

# Create and switch branches
$ mygit branch feature
$ mygit checkout feature
Switched to branch 'feature'

# Make changes and merge
$ echo "New feature" >> README.md
$ mygit add README.md
$ mygit commit -m "Add new feature"
$ mygit checkout main
$ mygit merge feature
Updating 1a2b3c4..2b3c4d5
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Storage System**:
   - Implement a content-addressable storage system using SHA-1 hashes
   - Create blob objects for file content
   - Create tree objects for directory structures
   - Create commit objects for snapshots with metadata

2. **Index (Staging Area)**:
   - Implement an index file to track staged changes
   - Support adding and removing files from the index
   - Handle file permissions and timestamps

3. **Working Directory Management**:
   - Track changes between working directory, index, and repository
   - Implement status checking to show modified, staged, and untracked files
   - Handle file restoration from the repository

4. **Commit History**:
   - Implement commit creation with parent references
   - Build commit history traversal algorithms
   - Support commit messages and author information

5. **Branching System**:
   - Implement references (refs) to track branch heads
   - Support branch creation, deletion, and switching
   - Handle HEAD pointer management

6. **Merging Algorithm**:
   - Implement three-way merge algorithms
   - Handle merge conflicts and resolution
   - Support fast-forward merges when possible

7. **Remote Repository Support**:
   - Implement pack file format for efficient network transfer
   - Support clone, push, and pull operations
   - Handle reference updates and synchronization

## Extra Credit

Extend your Git implementation with the following features:

1. **Advanced Diff Algorithms**:
   - Implement Myers' diff algorithm for better change detection
   - Add support for word-level and character-level diffs
   - Implement rename detection

2. **Pack Files**:
   - Implement pack file format for space-efficient storage
   - Add delta compression for similar objects
   - Support pack file indexing and retrieval

3. **Advanced Merging**:
   - Implement recursive merge strategy for complex histories
   - Add support for merge strategies (ours, theirs, octopus)
   - Implement interactive merge conflict resolution

4. **Hooks System**:
   - Support pre-commit, post-commit, and other hooks
   - Allow custom scripts to run at various Git operations
   - Implement hook configuration and management

5. **Submodules**:
   - Add support for embedding other repositories as submodules
   - Handle submodule initialization and updates
   - Support nested submodule operations

6. **Advanced History Operations**:
   - Implement `rebase` for changing commit history
   - Add `cherry-pick` for applying specific commits
   - Support `bisect` for finding problematic commits

7. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement bitmap indexes for faster operations
   - Add multi-threading support for parallel operations
   - Optimize large repository handling

By building this Git clone, you'll gain profound insights into version control systems, distributed computing, and the data structures that power modern software development. This knowledge will help you become a more effective developer and better understand the tools you use daily.
