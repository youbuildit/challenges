This challenge is inspired by the `ping` command-line tool, one of the most fundamental network diagnostic utilities. The `ping` tool uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time to remote hosts. By building your own version of `ping`, you'll learn about network protocols, raw socket programming, and packet construction.

## Table of Contents

The `ping` command demonstrates several key networking concepts:

- **ICMP Protocol**: Use Internet Control Message Protocol for network diagnostics.
- **Raw Sockets**: Work directly with network packets at a low level.
- **Network Timing**: Measure network latency and packet loss.
- **DNS Resolution**: Convert hostnames to IP addresses for testing.

Understanding how `ping` works is essential for network troubleshooting and gives insight into how network diagnostic tools operate.

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a network connectivity testing tool that sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target host and measures the response times. The tool should provide statistics about packet loss, round-trip times, and network connectivity status.

## ICMP Protocol Basics

Your ping implementation should understand the ICMP protocol:

1. **ICMP Header Structure**:
   - Type (8 bits): 8 for Echo Request, 0 for Echo Reply
   - Code (8 bits): 0 for ping messages
   - Checksum (16 bits): Error detection
   - Identifier (16 bits): Process identification
   - Sequence Number (16 bits): Packet ordering

2. **Echo Request/Reply**:
   - Send Echo Request (Type 8) packets to target
   - Receive Echo Reply (Type 0) packets from target
   - Match requests with replies using identifier and sequence

3. **Timing and Statistics**:
   - Measure round-trip time (RTT) for each packet
   - Calculate minimum, maximum, and average RTT
   - Track packet loss percentage

## Supported Features

Your ping tool should support:

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Send ICMP Echo Request packets
   - Receive and process Echo Reply packets
   - Display round-trip times and statistics
   - Handle DNS resolution for hostnames

2. **Command-Line Options**:
   - `-c count`: Number of packets to send
   - `-i interval`: Time between packets (seconds)
   - `-t ttl`: Time-to-live value
   - `-s size`: Packet size in bytes
   - `-W timeout`: Timeout for each packet

3. **Statistics and Reporting**:
   - Real-time packet results
   - Final summary statistics
   - Packet loss calculation
   - RTT min/max/avg calculations

## Example Usage

Here's how your ping tool should work:

```bash
# Basic ping to hostname
$ ping google.com
PING google.com (142.250.184.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lga25s62-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.184.14): icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=12.3 ms
64 bytes from lga25s62-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.184.14): icmp_seq=2 ttl=118 time=11.8 ms
64 bytes from lga25s62-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.184.14): icmp_seq=3 ttl=118 time=12.1 ms
^C
--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 11.8/12.1/12.3/0.2 ms

# Ping with specific count
$ ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=14.2 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=119 time=13.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=119 time=14.1 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=119 time=14.0 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 13.9/14.0/14.2/0.1 ms

# Custom packet size and interval
$ ping -s 1000 -i 2 -c 3 localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 1000(1028) bytes of data.
1008 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.045 ms
1008 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.042 ms
1008 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.041 ms

# Handle unreachable hosts
$ ping 192.168.999.999
ping: cannot resolve 192.168.999.999: Unknown host

# Timeout handling
$ ping -W 1 -c 3 10.0.0.1
PING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Resolve hostnames to IP addresses using DNS lookup
   - Handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   - Provide clear error messages for resolution failures

2. **Raw Socket Creation**:
   - Create raw ICMP sockets (requires privileges on most systems)
   - Set socket options for TTL, timeout, and packet size
   - Handle platform-specific socket differences

3. **ICMP Packet Construction**:
   - Build ICMP Echo Request packets with proper headers
   - Calculate and set ICMP checksums
   - Include identifier and sequence numbers for tracking

4. **Packet Transmission and Reception**:
   - Send ICMP packets at specified intervals
   - Receive and validate ICMP replies
   - Match replies to requests using identifier and sequence

5. **Timing and Statistics**:
   - Record timestamps for RTT calculation
   - Maintain statistics for transmitted/received packets
   - Calculate min/max/average RTT values

## ICMP Packet Structure

```python
import struct
import time

class ICMPPacket:
    def __init__(self, packet_type, code, identifier, sequence, data=b''):
        self.type = packet_type
        self.code = code
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.sequence = sequence
        self.data = data
        self.checksum = 0
    
    def pack(self):
        # Pack header without checksum
        header = struct.pack('!BBHHH', 
                           self.type, self.code, 0, 
                           self.identifier, self.sequence)
        
        # Calculate checksum
        packet = header + self.data
        self.checksum = self.calculate_checksum(packet)
        
        # Repack with correct checksum
        header = struct.pack('!BBHHH',
                           self.type, self.code, self.checksum,
                           self.identifier, self.sequence)
        
        return header + self.data
    
    def calculate_checksum(self, data):
        # ICMP checksum calculation
        checksum = 0
        for i in range(0, len(data), 2):
            if i + 1 < len(data):
                checksum += (data[i] << 8) + data[i + 1]
            else:
                checksum += data[i] << 8
        
        checksum = (checksum >> 16) + (checksum & 0xFFFF)
        checksum += checksum >> 16
        return ~checksum & 0xFFFF

def send_ping(target_ip, identifier, sequence):
    # Create ICMP Echo Request
    timestamp = struct.pack('!d', time.time())
    packet = ICMPPacket(8, 0, identifier, sequence, timestamp)
    
    # Send packet and measure RTT
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.IPPROTO_ICMP)
    send_time = time.time()
    sock.sendto(packet.pack(), (target_ip, 0))
    
    # Receive reply and calculate RTT
    reply, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
    recv_time = time.time()
    rtt = (recv_time - send_time) * 1000  # Convert to milliseconds
    
    return rtt, addr[0]
```
