This challenge is inspired by DNS (Domain Name System) resolvers, the fundamental infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. DNS is one of the most critical Internet protocols, enabling the web as we know it to function. By building your own DNS resolver, you'll learn about network protocols, packet parsing, and the hierarchical nature of Internet naming.

## Table of Contents

DNS resolution demonstrates several important networking and systems concepts:

- **Protocol Implementation**: Build packets according to RFC specifications.
- **Recursive Queries**: Navigate the hierarchical DNS system from root to authoritative servers.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement efficient caching to reduce query times and network load.
- **UDP Communication**: Handle unreliable transport with timeouts and retries.

Understanding DNS is crucial for network programming and helps explain how the Internet's naming system operates at a fundamental level.

## The Challenge

Your task is to create a DNS resolver that can translate domain names to IP addresses by querying DNS servers directly. The resolver should handle different record types, implement caching, and support both recursive and iterative queries.

## DNS Protocol Basics

Your DNS resolver should understand the core DNS protocol:

1. **DNS Message Structure**:
   - Header: ID, flags, question/answer/authority/additional counts
   - Question section: Domain name, query type, query class
   - Answer section: Resource records with TTL values
   - Authority and Additional sections for delegation and optimization

2. **Common Record Types**:
   - A: IPv4 address
   - AAAA: IPv6 address
   - CNAME: Canonical name (alias)
   - MX: Mail exchange
   - NS: Name server
   - TXT: Text records
   - PTR: Reverse DNS lookup

3. **Query Process**:
   - Start with root name servers (.)
   - Follow NS records down the hierarchy
   - Cache responses with TTL-based expiration
   - Handle CNAME redirections

## Supported Features

Your DNS resolver should support:

1. **Basic Resolution**:
   - Resolve A records (IPv4 addresses)
   - Handle CNAME aliases and chains
   - Support multiple IP addresses per hostname
   - Implement proper error handling for NXDOMAIN

2. **Advanced Query Types**:
   - AAAA records for IPv6
   - MX records for mail servers
   - TXT records for domain verification
   - NS records for nameserver information

3. **Caching and Performance**:
   - TTL-based cache management
   - Negative caching for non-existent domains
   - Cache statistics and management
   - Configurable cache size limits

## Example Usage

Here's how your DNS resolver should work:

```python
# Basic hostname resolution
resolver = DNSResolver()
ip_addresses = resolver.resolve("google.com", "A")
print(ip_addresses)  # ['142.250.184.14', '142.250.184.46', ...]

# IPv6 resolution
ipv6_addresses = resolver.resolve("google.com", "AAAA")
print(ipv6_addresses)  # ['2607:f8b0:4004:c07::71', ...]

# Mail server lookup
mx_records = resolver.resolve("gmail.com", "MX")
for priority, server in mx_records:
    print(f"Priority {priority}: {server}")

# Text records
txt_records = resolver.resolve("_dmarc.google.com", "TXT")
print(txt_records)  # ['v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; ...']

# Reverse DNS lookup
hostname = resolver.reverse_lookup("8.8.8.8")
print(hostname)  # dns.google.

# With caching
resolver = DNSResolver(cache_enabled=True, cache_ttl_max=3600)
start_time = time.time()
resolver.resolve("example.com", "A")
first_query_time = time.time() - start_time

start_time = time.time()
resolver.resolve("example.com", "A")  # Should be much faster
cached_query_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"First query: {first_query_time:.3f}s")
print(f"Cached query: {cached_query_time:.3f}s")
```

## DNS Message Format

Your resolver should construct and parse DNS messages:

```python
import struct

class DNSHeader:
    def __init__(self, id, flags=0x0100):  # Standard query with recursion desired
        self.id = id
        self.flags = flags
        self.qdcount = 0  # Questions
        self.ancount = 0  # Answers
        self.nscount = 0  # Authority RRs
        self.arcount = 0  # Additional RRs
    
    def pack(self):
        return struct.pack('!HHHHHH', 
                          self.id, self.flags, self.qdcount,
                          self.ancount, self.nscount, self.arcount)

class DNSQuestion:
    def __init__(self, name, qtype=1, qclass=1):  # A record, IN class
        self.name = name
        self.qtype = qtype
        self.qclass = qclass
    
    def pack(self):
        # Encode domain name with length-prefixed labels
        labels = self.name.split('.')
        encoded_name = b''
        for label in labels:
            if label:  # Skip empty label at end
                encoded_name += bytes([len(label)]) + label.encode('ascii')
        encoded_name += b'\x00'  # Null terminator
        
        return encoded_name + struct.pack('!HH', self.qtype, self.qclass)

def create_dns_query(domain, record_type='A'):
    query_id = random.randint(1, 65535)
    header = DNSHeader(query_id)
    header.qdcount = 1
    
    type_map = {'A': 1, 'NS': 2, 'CNAME': 5, 'MX': 15, 'TXT': 16, 'AAAA': 28}
    question = DNSQuestion(domain, type_map.get(record_type, 1))
    
    return header.pack() + question.pack(), query_id

def send_dns_query(query_packet, server='8.8.8.8', port=53, timeout=5):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.settimeout(timeout)
    
    try:
        sock.sendto(query_packet, (server, port))
        response, addr = sock.recvfrom(4096)
        return response
    finally:
        sock.close()
```

## Implementation Steps

2. **UDP Communication**:
   - Send queries to DNS servers over UDP
   - Handle timeouts and retransmissions
   - Parse responses and extract answers
   - Deal with truncated responses (TC flag)

3. **Response Parsing**:
   - Parse DNS headers and validate response codes
   - Extract answers from response sections
   - Handle compression in domain name encoding
   - Decode different record types properly

4. **Recursive Resolution**:
   - Start queries at root name servers
   - Follow NS records to find authoritative servers
   - Handle referrals and iterative queries
   - Build complete resolution path

5. **Caching Implementation**:
   - Store responses with TTL-based expiration
   - Implement cache lookup before sending queries
   - Handle negative caching for NXDOMAIN responses
   - Provide cache statistics and management

```python
class DNSCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=10000):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.stats = {'hits': 0, 'misses': 0}
    
    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            record, expiry = self.cache[key]
            if time.time() < expiry:
                self.stats['hits'] += 1
                return record
            else:
                del self.cache[key]
        
        self.stats['misses'] += 1
        return None
    
    def put(self, key, value, ttl):
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            # Remove oldest entries
            oldest_key = min(self.cache.keys(), 
                           key=lambda k: self.cache[k][1])
            del self.cache[oldest_key]
        
        expiry = time.time() + ttl
        self.cache[key] = (value, expiry)

class RecursiveResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root_servers = [
            '198.41.0.4',    # a.root-servers.net
            '199.9.14.201',  # b.root-servers.net
            '192.33.4.12',   # c.root-servers.net
            # ... more root servers
        ]
        self.cache = DNSCache()
    
    def resolve_recursive(self, domain, record_type='A'):
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = (domain, record_type)
        cached_result = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result:
            return cached_result
        
        # Start with root servers
        current_servers = self.root_servers
        labels = domain.split('.')
        
        for i in range(len(labels)):
            # Query current level
            partial_domain = '.'.join(labels[i:])
            response = self.query_servers(partial_domain, record_type, current_servers)
            
            if response.answers:
                # Found answer
                self.cache.put(cache_key, response.answers, response.ttl)
                return response.answers
            elif response.authority:
                # Follow delegation
                current_servers = [ns.target for ns in response.authority if ns.type == 'NS']
            else:
                raise DNSException("No answer or authority section")
        
        raise DNSException("Resolution failed")
```
